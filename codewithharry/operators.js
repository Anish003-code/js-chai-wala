// operators are basically the simple calculations that are incoled in the js 
  let a = 99 , b = 2;
console.log(a+b);
    console.log(a-b);
console.log(a/b);// unlike in c js gives the proper decimal values
console.log(a*b);
// exponential operator ** example a**b meaning a to the power b
console.log(a**b);
console.log(a%b);
console.log(a++); // here after giving the value of a its value gets increased by 1 as it is called as increment  operator
// same goes for the decrement operators 
console.log(a);
console.log(++a);
// console.log(a);
console.log(a);
// arhenmatric operators 
console.log(a+=b); // a = a+b;
//comparison operators
